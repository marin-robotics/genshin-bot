This repository contains the code for 2456X's Over Under robot.
Basically the only unique functions in the code that may be potentially useful to other robots are move and turn
To use said functions, copy the functions and all associated variables, input the bot specific items- wheel diameter, etc, and test at a known distance, adjusting the tuning factors as needed.
